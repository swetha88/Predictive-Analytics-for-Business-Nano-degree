# Predictive Analytics for Business using Alteryx designer

**Project Portfolio from Udacity Nano degree**

**Tools Used: Alteryx designer(Predictive tool), tableau**

**Predict diamond prices project:**
*A jewelry company wants to put in a bid to purchase a large set of diamonds, but is unsure how much it should bid. In this project, used the results from a predictive model to make a recommendation on how much the jewelry company should bid for the diamonds.*

**Project Details:**
*To decide how much to bid, used a large database of diamond prices to build a regression model to predict the price of a diamond based on its attributes. then used the results of that model to make a recommendation for how much the company should bid.*

**Predict Catalog Demand project overview:**
*The manufacturers company sells high-end home goods, wants to determine how much profit the company can expect from sending a catalog to the new customers. and need to predict the expected profit from 250 new customers, Management does not want to send the catalog out to these new customers unless the expected profit contribution exceeds $10,000.
To predict the expected profit from the new customers, used the historical data that company has, Last year the manufacturers company has sent out its first catalog, based on the previous data we can build the linear regression model to predict the expected profit since the target variable is numeric variable.*

**Project_Data wrangling:**
*A school district wants to predict the per pupil costs of a school based on some high-level summary data about the school. This way they have a good estimation of how well a school is managing its costs relative to what the model would predict. For further analysis needs to   prepare the data for modelling.*

**Data Preparation:** 

•	Combine/blend the data

•	Clean the Data

•	Identify and Deal with Outliers

**Project_ Recommend new city for the pet store:**
*performed an analysis to recommend the city for newest store, based on predicted yearly sales.

**Applied skills:** Data preparation, data modeling, Linear regression.

**Project _Predict creditworthy customers:**
A small bank that needs to come up with an efficient solution to classify new customers on whether they can be approved for a loan or not. Used a series of classification models to figure out the best model to provide a list of creditworthy customers to the manager.

**Applied skills:**

•	Cleanup, format, and blend a wide range of data sources

•	Build predictive classification models using Logistic Regression, Decision Tree, Random Forest, and Boosted Model

**Project _ Launch New Menu (A/B Testing):**
*A coffee restaurant in the United States of America. The executive team conducted a market test with a new menu and needs to figure whether the new menu can drive enough sales to offset the cost of marketing the new menu.  Analyzed the A/B test and write up a recommendation to whether the Round Roasters chain should launch this new menu.*

**Applied skills:**

•	Cleanup, format, and blend a wide range of data sources

•	Plan and analyze A/B tests

**Project_Forecast video Game Sales:**
*A company that creates and sells video games, have to be on point when it comes to ordering supplies to meet the demand of its customers. An overestimation of demand leads to bloated inventory and high costs. Underestimating demand means many valued customers won't get the products they want. So, to forecast monthly sales data in order to synchronize supply with demand, aid in decision making that will help build a competitive infrastructure and measure company performance.* 

**Skills Applied:**

•	Investigate and Prepare the Data

•	Determined Trend, Seasonal and Error components

•	Build ARIMA and ETS Models

•	Forecast
